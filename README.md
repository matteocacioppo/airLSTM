# LSTM for CO Concentration Forecasting  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project implements an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model** to forecast **carbon monoxide (CO) concentration** using the **UCI Air Quality dataset**. The model is trained to predict future CO levels based on past concentration values, helping in air pollution analysis and prediction.  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset: UCI Air Quality  
The dataset used is the **UCI Air Quality Dataset**, which contains sensor readings of pollutants, temperature, and humidity collected hourly in an Italian city.  

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality)  
- **Features Used:** CO concentration over time  
- **Target Variable:** Future CO concentration  

## ðŸš€ Model Architecture  
The model is a **deep learning-based time series forecaster** built using **PyTorch**. It consists of:  
âœ… **LSTM Layer** â€“ Captures temporal dependencies  
âœ… **Fully Connected (Linear) Layer** â€“ Outputs the predicted CO value  
âœ… **MSE Loss Function** â€“ Measures prediction accuracy  
âœ… **Adam Optimizer** â€“ Optimizes model weights
